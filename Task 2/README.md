| **Token Support** | Yes (Native: ETH, and others) | Yes (Chaincode can manage tokens) | Yes |
| **Typical Use Case** | Decentralized Apps (dApps), NFTs | Supply Chain, B2B Networks | Finance, Inter-bank transfers |
| **Notable Technical Feature** | Large, decentralized network | Modular and pluggable architecture | High-speed, private transactions |

## Short Report and Recommendations

When comparing these three platforms, the biggest differences are their **permission models** and **performance**.

**Ethereum** is a **public** blockchain, meaning anyone can join and participate. This makes it highly decentralized and transparent but also slower and less private than the others. Its strength lies in its massive, open community and its native cryptocurrency, Ether.

**Hyperledger Fabric** and **JPMorgan Quorum** are both **permissioned**, which means you need an invitation to join the network. This makes them much faster and more private. Fabric is known for its **modular design**, allowing businesses to plug in the components they need. Quorum, built on Ethereum, is specialized for the financial industry, with a focus on high-speed and private transactions.

## Recommendations for Specific Use Cases

### 1. Decentralized App (dApp)
* **Choice:** **Ethereum**
* **Reasoning:** As a public and open platform, Ethereum is the best choice for a dApp. It provides a large, built-in user base and a truly decentralized environment, which are key for most dApps to succeed.

### 2. Supply Chain Network Among Known Partners
* **Choice:** **Hyperledger Fabric**
* **Reasoning:** Fabric's permissioned model and modular architecture are perfect for a supply chain. It allows partners to have their own private channels for confidential information while still sharing a single, trusted ledger. Its high performance can also handle the large volume of transactions common in supply chains.

### 3. Inter-bank Financial Application
* **Choice:** **JPMorgan Quorum**
* **Reasoning:** Quorum was designed by a bank, for banks. Its focus on **privacy** and **high-speed transactions** is exactly what's needed for financial applications. Its permissioned nature ensures that only authorized banks can participate, which is a must for security and compliance in the financial world.

Each platform has its unique strengths and is suited for different use cases. The choice of platform should be based on the specific requirements of the project, considering factors such as:

* Permission requirements
* Performance needs
* Privacy concerns
* Development expertise available
* Community support
* Integration requirements
